Look carefully at what a percentage length means in this context:
The inset is a percentage relative to the containing block’s size in the corresponding axis (e.g. width for left or right, height for top and bottom). For sticky positioned boxes, the inset is instead relative to the relevant scrollport’s size. Negative values are allowed.
The height of the containing block is auto (the default) and when a percentage is calculated of auto you get 0 -->
