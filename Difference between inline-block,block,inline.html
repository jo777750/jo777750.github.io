 <!--  inline-block is a CSS display property value that allows an element to be displayed as an inline-level block container. This means that the element is laid out as an inline-level element, like an inline element such as a span or <a> tag, but it also behaves like a block-level element, such as a div or p tag, in that it can have width, height, padding, margin, and border properties applied to it.-->   <a style="display:inline-block; width:100px;height:200px;">A for Apple</a>
